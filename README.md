# Instructions for PyCon sprints May 2021

Welcome to the Fairlearn sprint at PyCon 2021! We're excited to have you!

## Event info

- [Mentored sprint](https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/mentored-sprints/)
- [General sprint](https://us.pycon.org/2021/events/development-sprints/)

## Preparation

1. Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. Clone the Fairlearn repository onto your machine using `git clone https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn.git`
4. Read through the ways to contribute in the [contributor guide](https://fairlearn.org/main/contributor_guide/index.html) to consider how you'd like to contribute.
5. Look at Fairlearn's issues on GitHub, specifically the ones marked ["help wanted"](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Within this category we've marked issues with labels
   - ["good first issue"](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) means issues are a good fit for first time contributors including people with no prior experience with coding or GitHub. This is an excellent way to get started!
   - ["easy"](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22easy%22+) means the issue is somewhat harder than a "good first issue", but still quite doable if you have prior experience or you're willing to spend a little bit of time.
   - neither of the two above: this means issues haven't been scoped out properly yet or are more difficult and likely won't be doable within a sprint. If you're still interested just let us know and we'll figure out a way!
   Once you find an issue you're interested in comment on the issue with any questions you may have and let us know that you'd like to do it. This helps us avoid duplication and we can help you quicker.
6. Whenever questions come up don't hesitate to reach out (see "Communication channels" below). We're here to help!

## Communication channels

The Fairlearn community uses [Gitter](https://gitter.im/fairlearn/community) for communication, but during the sprints we have dedicated Discord channels:
